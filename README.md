Decentralized Oracle Network (DON) Project
Project Concept
The Decentralized Oracle Network (DON) aims to provide secure, reliable, and tamper-proof data feeds for smart contracts on Ethereum and other blockchains. Leveraging EigenLayer's restaking capabilities and Movement Labs' SDK, DON enhances security and facilitates seamless integration.

Overview
DON ensures data accuracy through distributed validation, aggregates data using consensus mechanisms, and secures the network through restaking mechanisms and slashing conditions for validators.

Key Features
Distributed Validation
Validators verify data from multiple sources to ensure accuracy.
Consensus mechanisms finalize validated data for use in smart contracts.
Restaking for Security
Validators restake tokens to participate in the network, enhancing security.
Slashing conditions deter malicious or faulty validators, maintaining network integrity.
Integration with Movement SDK
Utilizes Movement Labs' SDK for seamless integration with Ethereum and Layer 2 solutions.
Data Feeds
Provides diverse data feeds including price feeds, weather data, sports scores, etc.
Secure APIs for developers to access data feeds for smart contract applications.
Project Structure
Smart Contracts
Manages data submission, validation, aggregation, and distribution.
Implements restaking contracts for managing validator stakes and slashing conditions.
Backend Services
Collects data from multiple sources, validates it through the oracle network, and submits it to smart contracts.
Coordinates validators and implements consensus mechanisms.
Frontend Interface
User-friendly interface for users to access data feeds.
Validator tools for managing stakes and participation in data validation.
Developer tools for integration with the oracle network.
